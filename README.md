# Audio-Book Management System

This project is an implementation of use of Tree data structure for data storage.The project implements an audiobook management system where in the data reguarding audiobooks,users,etc get stored in nodes of trees.The project implements AVL Tree so as to effectively manage the height of the tree,hence reducing the retrieval time

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone [https://link-to-project](https://github.com/Raj2604/AudioBook-Management-System)
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd AudioBook-Management-System-using-Trees
```

* Be sure to download the corresponding input.txt file
* Once done with installation - tweak the input as required

For running the code 
* In Linux
```bash
  gcc final.c -o final
  ./final
```
* In Windows
```bash
  gcc final.c -o final.exe
  ./final.exe
```




## Future Enhancements

* The efficient data retrival can be more enhances by using B Trees or B+ Trees
* Creating a frontend application integrating with this backend application to create a full - fledged audio-book management system
